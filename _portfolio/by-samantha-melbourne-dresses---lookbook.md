Today I want to share with you one of my latest photo session in Melbourne. I worked for a clothes brand [BySamantha](https://bysamantha.net). And this is a mix of a fashion photography, lookbook or catalogue and romantic portrait photography. We did our photosession in beautiful Carlton Gardens.

I don't remember how I found Samantha. Probably, it was on Instagram; I surfed on it for an inspiration and I found the post about creative and talented women of Melbourne. After that I saw Samantha on Designers Expo in Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne and I was so inspired by he and her dresses! She is so energetic and talented woman!

By the way, I messaged her about my feelings and offered my service as a photographer at any time. And after that she asked me to take some photos of her new dresses in **street style photography**.

We finished with very romantic and relaxed **lookbook** photoshoot. I am absolutely thrilled how it all turned out! I live colors and how they matched with the dresses. The light was beautiful.

I was so happy to work with Samantha and her brand! It was so good to create something good together. Hope to collaborate with her in a nearest future.
