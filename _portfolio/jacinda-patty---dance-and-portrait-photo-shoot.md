Do you want to do dance photo shoot or relaxed portrait photoshoot on the fancy streets of Melbourne? Book me,!

If you ask me how did I meet Jacinda the answer would be "I don't know". Funny, but there was a magical coincidence. I was looking for a model on the Instagram and I found a very good one; I checked her feed and saw another beautiful girl who loves to dance. It was Jacinda.

I beliebe that artists should support each other, but what is most important - girls should support girls. I desperatelyÂ   wanted to show Jacinda, her beauty and her talent to everyone on the planet. And also I wanted to do a dance photography photo session.

I messaged her without any hope she will text me back (it happens because most of the people doesn't read direct messages in Instagram) but she did and we agreed to take some photos out there, on fancy streets of Fitzroy and Collingwood of Melbourne.

The photo shoot was great! Then I found out that Jacinda was preparing for her physical theatre show ["Boxed in Sideways"](https://melbournefringe.com.au/event/boxed-in-sideways/) by Three Feet Rising during the [Melbourne Fringe Festival](https://melbournefringe.com.au/). And 3 weeks later I did a behind the scenen and show photographer for her and her girls! How amazing is that?
