Today I want to share with you my special project. Milk Bath Photosessions! It all started in Brisbane. And continued in Sydney. And now I do milk bath photosessions in Melbourne. Yay!

This is a story how it all started.

I saw a photo of pregnant woman in a bathtub full of milk on Instagram; I really liked the photo and I messaged my new friend in Brisbane, who was pregnant at the moment that I would love to do somthiing similar. And then I had been trying to convince her that it is a very good idea to save a memory about pregnancy in this romantic and unusual way for several months. And finally, she agreed.

We took a great photos; she loved them; I loved them. Since then I always invite my models, friend and clients to do milk bath photoshoots. Because it is not only for pregnancy; it suits everyone. 

Milk Bath is a unique experience and you get a soft nice "after spa" skin as a bonus.

I was very delicate during my first milk bath photoshoot; since then I learnt a lot of things and now can go absolutely crazy with that. It is not only milk now. I use clear water, bubbles, glitter, colors and Lush bombs etc.
