During my internship program in [the photo studio australia](https://thephotostudio.com.au/) (studio in Melbourne) I needed a model for my first **studio photo session**. 

I cried and Amitha heard. We took great photos that day and I am thrilled to show you the result. 

I like studio photography because in studio I am not limited with weather forecast (and this is very imporant here, in Melbourne, where weather is absolutely unpredictable) and I am in control of light and the light is consistent. So both photographer and model can concentrate on posing and facial expressions.

I booked the studio for three hours so we had enough time to try everything. First location was a stage with natural light, then cyclorama with coloured gels and then black background.
