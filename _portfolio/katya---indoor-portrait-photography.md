Sometimes you can combine indoor photo session with natural light and this is great opportunity to create a fine-art portrait without artificial light.

Katya is my long-term friend and she is a photographer too, so this photosession was a true collaboration between us.

I used three types of light during the portrain session: very directional strong light thgrough the curtains from the window, backlight and soft diffused light from the big window covered with lightweight white curtain.
