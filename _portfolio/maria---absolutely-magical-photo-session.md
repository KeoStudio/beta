Maria is a very special model for me. She is my close friend; I took a lot of photos with her, when I lived n Brisben and every time I am fell in love. She is absolutely gorgeous, kind and lovele young woman. I am honored to collaborate with a beauty of that kind. 

Probably, now I said enough. Let me introduce my favourite photo session ever.

We booked a cafe in Brisbane for the session. We took many photos but I want to share these four because they remind me of Harry Potter novel. The natural light was unbelivable. I added some sparkles in post-processing to enchance my feelings.

I look at the photos and see Room of Requirement or dusty old class in Hogwarts.
